# Strapi custom plugin ðŸš€

This repository contains a custom plugin developed for **Stripe** called "form". The plugin integrates with Strapi's design system to ensure its components align with the overall interface of Strapi. It includes a custom form component validated by a custom hook, allowing seamless communication between the plugin and its database for content management.

Additionally, the plugin exposes an API that is consumed by an external form. The fields of this external form undergo a validation process both before submission and during data processing in the plugin's API.

Once there are records in the database, the functionality of downloading the information in the selected format between JSON and CSV is offered.

## Features

- **Custom Form Component**: The plugin includes a dynamic form component built with Strapi's design system.
- **Custom Hook Validation**: A custom hook is implemented to validate the form fields before data submission.
- **API Integration**: The plugin communicates with its database via an API, which is also consumed by an external form.
- **Field Validation**: Both internal and external forms validate the data through strict rules before processing in the API.
- **Data Download**: You can download the plugin's data as JSON or CSV file.
